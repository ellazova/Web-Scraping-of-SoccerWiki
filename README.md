# Web-Scraping-of-SoccerWiki
Basic scraping of SoccerWiki.org with 3 different tools(BS, Scrapy, Selenium)

First, pip install/import neeeded libraries and tools. 
Second, download the files for each of three tools.
Run the BS file by using python3 filename.py
For spider run the file by scrapy rundspider filename.py
Same step for Selenium as in BS.

Then you can observe the generated csv files in whatever folder they are saved,
usually they will be in Downloads folder, however it may vary.

When it comes to the results of correlation tests and clustering done on 
the dataset. The file was uploaded as ipynb since it was done in JupyterLab.
It was quicker since the dataset consisted of only 100 rows.
All the comments are in the same ipynb file in order to understand the analysis.
